## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm/yarn/pnpm
- Database (PostgreSQL recommended)
- UploadThing account

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dropin.git
   cd dropin
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file:

   ```env
   # Database
   DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
   
   # UploadThing
   UPLOADTHING_TOKEN="your-uploadthing-token"
   
   # Cron Jobs
   CRON_SECRET="your-cron-secret-key"
   ```

4. **Set up the database**

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

5. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## üìã Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection string | ‚úÖ |
| `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` | UploadThing API token | ‚úÖ |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Secret key for cron job authentication | ‚úÖ |

## üîí Security Architecture

### Client-Side Encryption Flow

1. User selects file
2. Generate AES-256-GCM key + IV on client
3. Encrypt file data client-side
4. Upload encrypted blob to UploadThing
5. Store file metadata in database
6. Generate shareable link with encryption key in URL fragment

### Download & Decryption Flow

1. User visits download link
2. Extract encryption key from URL fragment (#)
3. Fetch encrypted file from UploadThing
4. Decrypt file client-side using key
5. Trigger download of decrypted file
6. Optionally delete file record if "delete on download" enabled

### Security Benefits

- **Zero-knowledge**: Server never sees plaintext files
- **Client-side keys**: Encryption keys never sent to server
- **URL fragments**: Keys in # portion aren't sent in HTTP requests
- **Temporary storage**: Files auto-expire and delete
- **No tracking**: No user accounts or persistent data

## ‚è∞ Automated Cleanup

Dropin includes automatic cleanup via Vercel Crons:

- **Schedule**: Daily at 5:00 AM UTC
- **Function**: Deletes expired files from both database and storage
- **Authentication**: Protected by `CRON_SECRET` environment variable
